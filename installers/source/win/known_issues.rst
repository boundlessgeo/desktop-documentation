**Boundless Desktop uninstaller**

* If Boundless Desktop 1.1 is installed in a custom directory as a sub-folder of
  the previous install directory, Boundless Desktop older version uninstaller
  (e.g. 1.0.1) will remove the newest version. However, using the default
  installation directory poses no issues, and the older versions removal won't
  affect the latest ones.
* Uninstaller leaves an empty ``Program Files\Boundless\Desktop\1.1`` directory
