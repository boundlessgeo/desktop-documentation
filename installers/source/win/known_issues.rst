**IPython and Jupyter consoles on Windows**

When using the Command Shell application, the following will produce errors:

* ``ipython``
* ``jupyter-console``

Alternatively, you can run these commands until a fix is provided:

* ``ipython --simple-prompt``
* ``jupyter-qtconsole`` (when run from a graphical user interface login)
