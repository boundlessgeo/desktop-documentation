Boundless Connect plugin for QGIS
---------------------------------

The central element of our QGIS installation is the Boundless Connect plugin, which acts as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. QGIS for Boundless Desktop includes all the core plugins of a standard QGIS installation, plus the Connect plugin. This provides access to Boundless Connect content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins. We will continue to add more content for customizing your QGIS interface, and for training and support.
