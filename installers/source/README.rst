To install Boundless Desktop in Windows, simply run the installer as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen.

The installer will ask you to choose the install location, which components to install, and the Start Menu Folder. After the installation, it will add a single Boundless Desktop shortcut that points to the applications shortcuts. It also adds entries in the start menu inside the selected folder (by default, “Boundless Desktop 1.0.0”).

Boundless Connect plugin for QGIS
---------------------------------

The central element of our QGIS installation is the Boundless Connect plugin, which acts as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. QGIS for Boundless Desktop includes all the core plugins of a standard QGIS installation, plus the Connect plugin. This provides access to Boundless Connect content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins. We will continue to add more content for customizing your QGIS interface, and for training and support.

Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall Boundless Desktop, run uninstaller.exe from the applications shortcuts folder in the start menu .
