To install Boundless Desktop in Windows, simply run the installer as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen.

The installer will ask you to choose the install location, which components to install, and the Start Menu Folder. After the installation, it will add a single Boundless Desktop shortcut that points to the applications shortcuts. It also adds entries in the start menu inside the selected folder (by default, "Boundless Desktop |version|").
