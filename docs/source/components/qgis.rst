About
-----

QGIS is the central piece of the Boundless Desktop package installation. The well known leading Open Source GIS for desktop, QGIS, is a cross-platform desktop application for viewing, editing, and analyzing geospatial data from a variety of (proprietary and open) vector, raster, and database formats.

QGIS’s development is steered by the `QGIS Project <www.qgis.org>`_, which works with hundreds of volunteers and companies (including Boundless spatial) from all over the world, that helps enhance and maintain QGIS.

For convenience, outside the supported scope of Boundless Desktop, the following processing providers are available for QGIS’s Processing framework:

* SAGA 2.1 by `<http://www.saga-gis.org>`_
* GRASS 7.0 by `<http://grass.osgeo.org>`_
* Orfeo Toolbox 5.0 by `<https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org>`_
