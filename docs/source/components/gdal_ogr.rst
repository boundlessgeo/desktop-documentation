========

About
-----

Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) is a cross-platform C++ translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the `Open Source Geospatial Foundation <http://www.osgeo.org>`. As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing. GDAL supports over 50 raster formats, and OGR over 20 vector formats.

In Boundless Desktop installation, GDAL/OGR utilities are available through QGIS or the installed Command Shell. The shipped version of GDAL/OGR includes two extra libraries, LibKML and OpenJPEG2, for .kmz and JPEG2000 support, respectively.
