Qt Designer for QGIS
====================

About
-----

Qt Designer is a Qt's Framework tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) from Qt components. With it, you can compose and customize widgets or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and also test them using different styles and resolutions.

Qt Designer is created by the same team that delivers the Qt Framework. See more information about it in `Qt official website <www.qt.io>`_

The shipped version brings a set of special widgets for QGIS that make it easier to create custom forms and dialogs for your PyQGIS projects and custom attribute editing forms within QGIS.

For more information on Qt Designer usage, check the Qt Designer Documentation.
