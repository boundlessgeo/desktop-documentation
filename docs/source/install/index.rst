Installing Boundless Desktop
============================

Boundless provides packages for Boundless Desktop on both Windows and OS X.

To install any of the open source software that ships with Boundless Desktop in Linux, please look for instructions in their communities' oficial documentation. The `components`_ section in this documents provide links for online resources for each one.

.. warning::

   For Linux users, **please do not try to run QGIS on the same machine as OpenGeo Suite**, as package conflicts will occur (specifically with GDAL). If you install OpenGeo Suite on a machine that has QGIS, **QGIS may be automatically uninstalled!**

   Instead, use QGIS on a different machine and connect to OpenGeo Suite services from there.
