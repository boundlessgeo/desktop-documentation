There is also an `Uninstall` shortcut to easily remove `Boundless Desktop` from
your computer. Please see :ref:`install.uninstall` for more information about
uninstalling procedures.

.. note::

   Users should not 'pin' the launched apps to the Windows taskbar because the
   pinned icons will not launch the apps correctly next time.

   In both Windows and Mac, there's a handy `Licenses` shortcut to access the
   licenses for each individual tool. Please make sure to consult those licenses,
   including Boundless EULA for Boundless desktop.

   There is also a link to Boundless Desktop's README file, that provide valuable
   information about it.

   For more information on how to use each tool, please see the :ref:`components`
   section.
