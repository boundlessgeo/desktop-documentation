For System Administrators
=========================

Starting from Boundless Desktop 1.1, there are available tools to help
system administrators deploy and manage Boundless Desktop in their
organization machines.

Currently, the tools are solely focused on QGIS, the main component of Boundless
Desktop, but it's planned to provide similar tools for the other applications in
the future.
