What is Boundless Desktop?
==========================

Boundless Desktop is a fully supported software package prepared by Boundless
and available for Windows and Mac OS X platforms. It's composed of open source
geospatial client-side tools and is capable of addressing the most demanding
desktop GIS users needs, including spatial analysis, data management,
cartography and web publishing.

Boundless Desktop |version| is composed of the following set of open source
tools:

* QGIS 3.4 by http://www.qgis.org
* PgAdmin 4 v3.? by `<http://www.pgadmin.org>`_
* Qt Designer 5.9? for QGIS by `<http://www.qt.io>`_
* GDAL/OGR 2.3 by `<http://www.gdal.org>`_
* ??:ref:`Support tool <support_tool_plugin>` plugin by Boundless??

.. Connect plugin for QGIS by Boundless

QGIS is built using Anaconda Python distribution, which gives access to
hundreads of scientific and data management libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas,
r, and jupyter)

Boundless Desktop is also extended by a set of Boundless-supported plugins for
QGIS. The plugins are aimed at improving QGIS functionality, but also for a better
integration with other Boundless products, like :server:`Boundless Server <>` and
:exchange:`Boundless Exchange <>`.

.. Commenting until necessary The central element of our QGIS installation is the
   :bd_plugins:`Boundless connect plugin <connect/1.1>`, which acts
   as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. This
   provides access to :connect:`Boundless Connect <>`
   content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins, basemaps,
   and knowledge-based content, like documentation, tutorials and lessons
   for lessons plugins.
