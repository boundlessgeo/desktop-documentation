   Boundless Desktop ecosystem

The central element of our QGIS installation is the `Boundless Connect plugin`_, which acts as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. This provides access to `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/>`_ content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins.

But Boundless Desktop is not composed solely of zeros and ones. It also comes with the deep technical knowledge and immediate readiness of Boundless experts. From product maintenance to day-to-day online support, whatever are your needs, there is a Boundless support plan suited for you (see more about it in `Boundless website <http://boundlessgeo.com/>`_).
