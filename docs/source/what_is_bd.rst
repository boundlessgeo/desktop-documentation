What is Boundless Desktop?
==========================

Boundless Desktop is a fully supported software package prepared by Boundless
and available for Windows and Mac OS X platforms. It's composed of open source
geospatial client-side tools and is capable of addressing the most demanding
desktop GIS users needs, including spatial analysis, data management,
cartography and web publishing.

Boundless Desktop |version| is composed of the following set of open source
tools:

Boundless Desktop is also enhanced by a set of Boundless-supported plugins for
QGIS, those are aimed at improving QGIS functionality, but also a better
integration with the other two Boundless Products: :server:`Boundless Server <index.html>` and :exchange:`Boundless Exchange <index.html>`. (See more in :ref:`qgis.plugins`)

The central element of our QGIS installation is the
:plugins:`Boundless connect plugin <connect/1.1/>`, which acts
as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. This
provides access to :connect:`Boundless Connect <>`
content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins, basemaps,
and knowledge-based content, like documentation, tutorials and lessons
for lessons plugins.

Boundless Desktop is not composed solely of zeros and ones! It also comes with
the deep technical knowledge and immediate readiness of Boundless experts. From
product maintenance and day-to-day online support, whatever are your needs,
there is a Boundless support plan suited for you (see more about it in
the Boundless Connect :connect:`page <Purchase-Boundless-Desktop>`).
