The central element of our QGIS installation is the `Boundless connect plugin
<https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/desktop/plugins/connect/1.1/>`_, which
acts
as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS. This
provides access to `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/>`_
content, which currently includes Boundless-supported plugins, basemaps,
and knowledge-based content, like documentation, tutorials and lessons
for lessons plugins.

Boundless Desktop is not composed solely of zeros and ones! It also comes with
the deep technical knowledge and immediate readiness of Boundless experts. From
product maintenance and day-to-day online support, whatever are your needs,
there is a Boundless support plan suited for you (see more about it in
the Boundless Connect `page
<https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/Purchase-Boundless-Desktop>`_).
